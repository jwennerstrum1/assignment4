The code for this project was largely base on Juan Jose's work found 
on here:
https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4

My udpates are posted to my github: https://github.com/jwennerstrum1/assignment4
I created my own maps as well as edited the animations so that traps and bonus locations
could be viewed

my java files to run are 
* assignment4.util.DifficultGridWorld
* assignment4.HardGridWorldLauncher

These should be run after creating an intelliJ project


I additionally made some matlab code to help produce figures
